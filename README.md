1st question is to build a program to manage a university's course catalog. so i define a base class Course that has the following properties: course_code: a string representing the course code (e.g., "CS101") course_name: a string representing the course name (e.g., "Introduction to Computer Science") credit_hours: an integer representing the credit hours for the course (e.g., 3) And it has two subclasses CoreCourse and ElectiveCourse, which inherit from the Course class. CoreCourse should have an additional property required_for_major which is a boolean representing whether the course is required for a particular major. ElectiveCourse should have an additional property elective_type which is a string representing the type of elective (e.g., "general", "technical", "liberal arts").
2nd question  to create a python module named employee that contains a class Employee with attributes name, salary and methods get_name() and get_salary(). and using this module we want to create an object of the Employee class and display its name and salary.
The module employee is attached seperately with this.
